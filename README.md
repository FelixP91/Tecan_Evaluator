# Tecan_Evaluator
Evaluates kinetic measurements by a TECAN photometer

## Description

This code takes the output file (.xlsx) generated by a TECAN photometer and calculates the maximum slopes for each measurement. It is assumed that fluorescence/absorption rises over time due to enzymatic activity. Several measurements can be present per sheet and several sheets can be present per file. First, curve smoothing is applied using the Savitzkyâ€“Golay filteer to kinetic data to reeduce the noise. Then, the averaged (to increase robustness) maximum slopes for a user-defined time interval are calculated. The maximum slopes are stored in a seperate output file generated by running the code. An example-TECAN file is provided (TECAN_output_file.xlsx) which can be used for running the code (input_file= path to TECAN_output_file.xlsx).
